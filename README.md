## Projects

- [Relational Database for General Workings of Gym ](https://github.com/JonathanL02/4610Fa24Group4/tree/main)  
  _Purpose of the project is to model and create a relational database describing the general workings of a gym. We displayed the relationships between the entities that we believe are the backbone and foundation every gym needs, and we populated the entities with sampling data to show how each relationship accurately represents the business. In addition, we used the data to perform queries to gather more information on the inner workings of a gym, and how these queries can help us lead to business decisions to further improve the gym. Developed a database project for Lifetime Fitness, utilizing SQL to query multiple datasets, identify business opportunities, and present key findings in a PowerPoint presentation._
