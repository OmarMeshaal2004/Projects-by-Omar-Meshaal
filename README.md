## Projects

- [Relational Database for General Workings of Gym ](https://github.com/OmarMeshaal2004/4610Fa24Group4)  
  _Purpose of the project is to model and create a relational database describing the general workings of a gym. We displayed the relationships between the entities that we believe are the backbone and foundation every gym needs, and we populated the entities with sampling data to show how each relationship accurately represents the business. In addition, we used the data to perform queries to gather more information on the inner workings of a gym, and how these queries can help us lead to business decisions to further improve the gym. Developed a database project for Lifetime Fitness, utilizing SQL to query multiple datasets, identify business opportunities, and present key findings in a PowerPoint presentation._

- [Montgomery County Vehicle Crash Visualization (2015-2024)](https://github.com/OmarMeshaal2004/4610Fa24Group4-2.git)
  _Analyzed Montgomery County crash data (2015-2024) using Tableau, filtering extraneous values, correcting inconsistencies, and visualizing injury severity by vehicle ._

- [Furventory – Digital Inventory System for Athens Area Humane Society](https://github.com/OmarMeshaal2004/Furventory-AAHS-Digital-Inventory-System.git)  
  The purpose of the project was to create a digital inventory system for the Athens Area Humane Center that streamlines donated goods tracking from intake through expiration. Core entities (donations, pet food, supplies, expiration dates) were modeled in a cloud-hosted Excel workbook and integrated with a mobile barcode-scanning app for real-time stock updates. Custom dashboards and automated alerts track inventory flow, flag high-risk items, and forecast reorder needs to improve accuracy and efficiency. Scalable storage solutions—including a repurposed shipping container and optimized zone layout—were proposed to reduce spoilage and reclaim facility space. All deliverables (schema diagrams, BPM workflows, training guides, interactive prototype, and PowerPoint deck) are compiled in a comprehensive project binder for seamless handover.
